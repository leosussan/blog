## What is your name?

My Name is Leo!

## What is your Quest?

Well, I have spent my career building & delivering results primarily in the realms of technology & digital advertising. I am currently focused on creating impactful solutions at the intersection of tech and progressive politics.

I currently serve as co-founder & CTO of **[Reach](https://reach.vote)**, a grassroots organizing platform that began its journey during the historic **[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress](https://ocasiocortez.com)** campaign in 2018, where I served as Technology Director. What started as a solution for one groundbreaking campaign has evolved into a platform that has empowered [thousands](https://www.reach.vote/clients/) of Democratic campaigns and progressive organizations to revolutionize how they connect with supporters and mobilize volunteers.

My career spans both political technology and private sector innovation. Before diving into political tech, I directed digital strategy for a venture-backed startup and led digital initiatives for major brands including American Express, GoPro, and Reckitt-Benckiser. This blend of corporate and political technology experience has shaped my approach to building scalable, impactful solutions.

Whether it's developing technology to power progressive movements or driving digital transformation for Fortune 500 companies, my quest remains consistent: to create meaningful change through technology, always staying foolishly optimistic (much like my devotion to the Mets & Knicks).

## What is your favorite color?
